**My main goal** is to improve my software engineering skills and try myself as a frontend developer. I am super disciplned and responsible person. In my free time, I spend my time coding some projects using **HTML, CSS, and JS**. I do not have a work experience in this sphere yet, but I am aspiring to become a good specialist, be committed to this course and my frontend development journey, improve my skills, and find a job at a good position.

## Programming skills:

- HTML, CSS, JS

## Code example:

```
function squareDigits(num){
  let strNum = num.toString();
  let resNum = [];

  for(let i = 0; i < strNum.length; i++){
  let temp = Number(strNum[i])\*\*2;
  resNum[i] = temp.toString();
  }

  return Number(resNum.join(""));
}
```
