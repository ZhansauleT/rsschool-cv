**My main goal** is to improve my software engineering skills and try myself as a frontend developer. I am super disciplned and responsible person. In my free time, I spend my time coding some projects using **HTML, CSS, and JS**. I do not have a work experience in this sphere yet, but I am aspiring to become a good specialist, be committed to this course and my frontend development journey, improve my skills, and find a job at a good position.

## Programming skills:

- HTML, CSS, JS
- Git
